# L-in-Discord

This is a Discord bot inspired by **L** from *Death Note*, designed to provide responses with a personality that matches L's genius-level deduction skills, occasional trolling, and socially awkward style. Using the Google Gemini model for natural language responses, the bot engages in conversations in a way that mirrors Lâ€™s character.

- `get_response.py`: Generates responses from Google Gemini based on user input and chat history.
